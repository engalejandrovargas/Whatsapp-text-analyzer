# Whatsapp-text-analyzer

In this project we analyze the text of a whatsApp conversation using the export txt file without media from the app.
The project was deployed using strimlit and you can use it from this URL: https://alejandro.streamlit.app/ (be aware that the app is sleeping and need to wake up from my side in strimlit, so it would look like raw HTML).
